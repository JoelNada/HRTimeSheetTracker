## Usage
### Uploading Employee Data
-Use the /upload/employees endpoint to upload Excel files (.xlsx).
-The file should contain employee details with columns matching your model fields.
-Rich text formatting in Excel cells is supported and handled programmatically.

### Uploading Timesheets
-Use the /upload/timesheets endpoint to upload weekly timesheets.
-Duplicate entries for the same (employeeId, date, task) update the existing record.
-Empty rows or invalid data are skipped and logged.

### Authentication & Roles
-Register and login to receive access tokens.
-API routes are protected by role-based middleware.
-Admin users can manage employees, roles, departments, and view reports.
-Employees submit their timesheet data offline (e.g., Excel files) which are then uploaded by authorized personnel.

### Generating Reports
-API endpoints support filtering and grouping by employee, department, role, and date ranges.
-Aggregated statistics (total hours worked, average hours, etc.) are available for management.
